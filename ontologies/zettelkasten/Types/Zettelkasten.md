The Zettelkasten ontology: the note types of the method (fleeting, literature, permanent, structure and project notes), the sources they come from (books and articles with their writers), the highlights you take from them and the topics that index it all.

The note type is the stage. A `FleetingNote` is a quick capture that you process within a day or two, a `LiteratureNote` is a source rewritten in your own words, and a `PermanentNote` is one idea that stands alone and links to other permanent notes. Moving a note forward means writing a new note and linking back with `derived_from`, `based_on` or `processed_into`, so the trail from capture to idea stays in the graph.

Every type gets a time-ordered `uid` when a note is created from it, and permanent notes can also take a Luhmann id (`1`, `1a`, `1a1`, `2`) through the child and sibling commands, so the slip box can branch the way Luhmann's did. The templates in `Templates/` fill in the title, date, ids and a link to the parent note.

A `Highlight` is raw text from a source and cites it with `highlighted_in`; a literature note says what it means with `based_on`. `StructureNote` and `ProjectNote` are the hub and the working note. Writers are `Writer` here so the ontology composes with the library's `Author`; label one person `[Author, Writer]` to share it.

`contradicts` and `derived_from` are declared once in the shared `core` ontology; this note only says which note types may use them and how to draw them.
