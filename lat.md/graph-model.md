# Graph Model

The in-memory property graph built from the vault: notes become labeled nodes, parsed lines become typed edges with properties.

## Nodes

One note is one node; headings and blocks are not nodes in v1.

Links to notes that do not exist become stub nodes, keyed by link text, so the graph has no dangling edges. Stubs are reference-counted and vanish with their last edge. Implemented by [[packages/core/src/graph/graph.ts#Graph]], which stores parsed edges per file so re-resolution after add, delete or rename needs no re-parse.

## Node types

A node's labels come from frontmatter `type: Person` or `type: [Person, Employee]`, which maps to multiple openCypher labels.

Configurable fallbacks map folder or tag to type when frontmatter is absent.

A non-empty frontmatter `title` becomes the node's `title` property; otherwise it is the file name.

A `types` list adds labels after those from `type`, deduplicated; the [[okf]] export writes it because OKF's `type` is a single string.

## Schema notes

A schema note such as `Types/Person.md` declares a type's properties, defaults, allowed edge types and visualization, in the spirit of typed templates.

Schema notes are optional; the graph works without them. Creating a note from a type applies its template.

A note directly in the schema folder (setting, default `Types/`) declares types in its frontmatter. `schema:` declares the type named by the note title, with the body as its template; `schemas:` declares any number of types by name, so one note can describe a whole subsystem; `edgeTypes:` declares edge types; `prefixes:` adds CURIE prefixes. All may appear together. The format is published as the open [[shacl#Typed Graph Schema]] specification.

A type has `properties` (map, kind shorthand or list; kinds text, number, boolean, date, datetime, link, list; `default`, `required`, `many`, `values`, `uri`), `edges` (absent means unrestricted; a list of types, or a map to target types or `{target, many, required}`), `template` (a link to a template note), `uri` and `visualization` (alias `style`, consumed by visualization config). An edge type has `from`, `to`, `properties`, `uri` and `visualization`. Read by [[packages/core/src/schema/schema.ts#readSchemaNote]] and collected by [[packages/core/src/schema/schema.ts#schemasFromGraph]], where the first declaration by path wins and duplicates are reported.

Validation is advisory and never removes anything from the graph ([[packages/core/src/schema/schema.ts#validateSchemas]]): required and enum properties, lists in single-valued properties, allowed, required and single edges, edge endpoint types (stubs and untyped notes are skipped) and edge properties. Multi-label notes merge schemas in label order: first property declaration wins, allowed edge rules are unioned. Identifiers are IRIs or CURIEs, with built-in prefixes and a base IRI (`urn:tgs:`) for the rest.

A type's `id` key (TGS 0.2) lists the identifiers a new note gets: `uuid`, a time-ordered `uuid7` that sorts as a string, a local `timestamp` (`YYYYMMDDHHmm`) or a branching `luhmann` id (`1`, `1a`, `1a1`, `2`), each stored in its own property, optionally also as a file name prefix, and automatic except Luhmann ids, which are placed under a parent note as a child or sibling or taken as the next top-level number ([[packages/core/src/schema/ids.ts#generateId]], [[packages/core/src/schema/newnote.ts#planNewNote]]).

Templates come from the note a type's `template` links to, else the body of a `schema:` note, else one generated from the schema ([[packages/core/src/schema/schema.ts#chooseTemplate]], [[packages/core/src/schema/schema.ts#renderNoteFromType]]); generated edge lines are empty `- type::` placeholders that create no edges. Template text may use `{{title}}`, `{{date}}`, `{{time}}`, `{{id}}`, `{{<id property>}}` and, under a parent, `{{parent}}`, `{{parent-id}}` and `{{parent-link}}`; a line that names the parent disappears when there is none, and other braces such as edge embeds are untouched. The Obsidian plugin offers all of this through a type menu (ribbon, folder context menu and command), and Luhmann child, sibling and top-level commands; VS Code has the same creation commands ([[vscode#Creating notes]]). Schemas are exchanged with RDF tools through [[shacl]].

## Edges

Edges carry a type, optional label, sign, properties, a derived or pinned ID and the heading they were written under.

Syntax is defined in [[edge-syntax]].

## Plain link edges

With the `linkEdges` graph option, every plain wikilink or markdown link to a note in prose becomes an untyped `links_to` edge (sign +1), as OKF consumers read links.

The option is off by default so existing vaults keep their graphs and queries; it is the third argument of [[packages/core/src/graph/graph.ts#Graph]] and is passed to the parser. Lines that already produce typed edges, fenced and inline code, frontmatter and image embeds (`![..](..)`, `![[..]]`) never yield link edges; missing targets become stubs as usual. The sidecar turns it on with `OBSIGRAPH_LINK_EDGES=1`.
