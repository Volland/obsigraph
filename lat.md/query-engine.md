# Query Engine

Queries are written in openCypher inside `graph-query` blocks and run through one interface backed by two engines.

## Two backends

The default engine is an in-plugin TypeScript interpreter over the live graph; an optional LadybugDB backend in the sidecar takes the same query text.

Both return the same `{columns, rows}` contract and are read-only. A block picks one with `backend: builtin|ladybug` or the plugin default; Ladybug blocks call the sidecar through [[packages/plugin/src/query/remote.ts#runRemote]], which maps every response to a result, a positioned error or a retry, and render asynchronously. See [[ladybug-mirror#Query translation]]. A conformance suite runs a 52-query corpus over a fixture vault on both engines ([[packages/sidecar/conformance/runner.ts#runCorpus]], rules in [[packages/sidecar/conformance/compare.ts#compare]]): any undocumented divergence fails, and intentional ones are listed in `packages/sidecar/conformance/differences.json` (UNWIND and CASE only on Ladybug; startNode, endNode, keys and properties only built-in). It caught Ladybug's walk semantics for variable-length paths, now translated to `TRAIL`. Re-record built-in expectations with `OBSIGRAPH_RECORD=1`.

## Supported subset

The in-plugin engine supports a read-only subset: matching, staging with `WITH`, optional matches, variable-length paths and aggregation, with everything else failing by name.

Parsed by [[packages/core/src/cypher/parser.ts#parseQuery]] and executed by [[packages/core/src/cypher/exec.ts#execute]] as a pipeline of clauses over row streams. Supported exactly:

- Clauses: `MATCH` and `OPTIONAL MATCH` (each with `WHERE`; optional rows keep nulls), `WITH` (aliases required for expressions; `DISTINCT`, `*`, `ORDER BY`, `SKIP`, `LIMIT`, then `WHERE`; only listed variables stay in scope), `RETURN [DISTINCT]` (including `*`), `ORDER BY`, `SKIP`, `LIMIT`.
- Patterns: labels, inline property maps, directed, incoming and undirected relationships, type alternation `[:a|b]`, comma-separated patterns, relationship uniqueness per MATCH, variable-length `*`, `*n`, `*n..m`, `*..m`, `*n..` (relationship variable binds a list; unbounded ranges stop at the depth cap, default 10, with a result notice) and path variables `p = (...)`.
- Expressions: literals, lists, maps, `$params`, property and index access, label predicates `n:Label`, arithmetic, comparisons, `IN`, `STARTS WITH`, `ENDS WITH`, `CONTAINS`, `IS [NOT] NULL`, three-valued `AND`/`OR`/`XOR`/`NOT`.
- Functions: `id`, `type`, `labels`, `keys`, `properties`, `startNode`, `endNode`, string helpers, `size`, `coalesce`, conversions, numeric helpers, `head`, `last`, `reverse`, `length`, `nodes`, `relationships`.
- Aggregates: `count` (incl. `count(*)`), `sum`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `collect`, each with optional `DISTINCT`; non-aggregate items are grouping keys; nulls ignored; empty input without keys yields 0, 0, null, null, null, []. Aggregates are rejected in `WHERE`.
- Built-in properties: `n.stub`, `r.id`, `r.sign`.

Write clauses fail as read-only; anything else outside this list fails as unsupported, naming the construct. Errors carry line and column.

## Query block

A `graph-query` fenced block holds a header (`view`, columns, styling) followed by the Cypher text.

The result shape picks the renderer unless the header overrides it: nodes, relationships or paths render as a graph, scalars as a table. Blocks re-run live on note changes, debounced. See [[visualization]].
