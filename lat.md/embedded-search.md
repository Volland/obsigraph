# Embedded Search

Planned: one embedded LadybugDB graph store per host holding graph, text and vectors, a bundled local embedding model, and one hybrid ranking pipeline for CLI, plugin (desktop and mobile) and sidecar.

Nothing here is implemented yet. A first iteration, improve-tg-search-ranking, fixes today's in-memory `tg search` (exact-identifier tier, section chunks, similarity floor) and adds a ranking evaluation. The rest is specified by five OpenSpec changes, deferred until there is demand: add-embedded-graph-store, add-local-embedding, add-hybrid-ranking, add-plugin-search, converge-sidecar-vectors. Decisions with lasting trade-offs are recorded in `docs/adr/` 0001 to 0003, and the vocabulary (Graph store, Card, Chunk, Fact, Model fingerprint, Shadow build, Vector pack, Graph boost, Context pack) in `CONTEXT.md`. When a change lands, its part of this page moves into [[vector-search]], [[ladybug-mirror]], [[cli#Search]] or [[sidecar]].

## Graph store per host

Every host keeps a derived LadybugDB database beside its corpus, through one `GraphStore` interface and one schema module in `core`.

The WASM build (`@ladybugdb/wasm-core` 0.21.2) statically links the vector (HNSW), full-text (BM25), JSON and algorithm extensions, needs no network install and no cross-origin isolation, and opens in about 250 ms from a cold CLI process. The plugin runs its async build in a Worker, the CLI and VS Code its Node sync build, and the sidecar keeps the native build with the extensions pre-installed. Vector and full-text indexes exist only on node tables, so searchable edges are reified. Locations: `.tg/graph.lbug` in the CLI, per-device IndexedDB in the plugin (never a synced folder), the data directory in the sidecar.

## Two-phase sync

Markdown reaches the store silently: a structural phase applies a signature diff in one transaction, and a vector phase fills embeddings from a queue without blocking it.

The diff is the sidecar's `diffMirror`, moved into `core`. The plugin syncs after `VaultIndex`'s debounced notifications, the CLI catches up by stat and hash before `search`, `retrieve` and `cypher`, and hooks never open the store. On mobile the vector phase runs only while the app is open and idle.

## Local embedding model

The CLI pre-bundles all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (lat.md's model) in a candle WASM runtime, so search is hybrid offline with no setup; the plugin downloads weights only on request.

Presets: `minilm-l6` (English, default), `bge-small-en` (English) and `e5-small-multi` (about 100 languages), plus custom Ollama and OpenAI-compatible models. MiniLM's vocabulary is English-only, so the plugin samples a vault's script mix at first run and recommends the multilingual preset above 10% non-Latin letters. A model fingerprint covers weights, pooling, prefixes, chunker and text templates; the stored fingerprint is authoritative and a change runs as a shadow build while the old index keeps answering. The plugin ships all code in `main.js` and downloads only weights, verified by sha256, because Obsidian's policies forbid installing dependencies at runtime.

## Searchable units and ranking

Vault nodes have a Card (what it is); every node has token-sized Chunks (where things are said); typed edges become Facts (which relationship). Lattice sections get no Card.

The baseline is lat.md 0.13, which is already hybrid: BM25 over chunks, an exact-identifier tier, cosine with a 0.2 floor and two-list RRF. The pipeline keeps all of that and adds Cards, Facts and the graph boost only where a held-out evaluation shows a gain.

Lists come from a `ListSource` interface, so ranking runs over today's in-memory index before the store lands: exact identifiers (including camelCase), BM25 over Chunks and Facts, and exact cosine scans over Chunks, Cards and Facts with a per-preset floor. Each list fetches until it holds 50 distinct nodes. Facts lift fully to their source and half to their target; weighted RRF fuses; a graph boost over typed edges only, degree-normalized and capped at a quarter of the top-20 score spread, may follow; exact-identifier nodes rank first; results group one per node. An HNSW index is used only above 50,000 units. `tg search` gains modes, targets, type filters, `--explain` and `--then`; `tg retrieve` and MCP `tg_retrieve` return the sidecar's context-pack contract.

## Plugin search and devices

The plugin gets a search view with an always-visible model status, a related-notes panel, and a copyable context pack; the model choice is per vault, semantic search can be off per device.

Devices share embeddings through a vector pack: content-addressed files of float16 vectors under the synced plugin folder, one per note version, so a phone reuses what a laptop embedded and sync conflicts are harmless.
